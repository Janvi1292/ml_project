In this project, we will construct a convolutional neural network (CNN) that will be trained on a training dataset that contains 4000 images of dogs and 4000 images of cats.For evaluation purposes, the CNN will then be tested on a test dataset that contains 1000 images of dogs and 1000 images of cats. Lastly, you are expected to use your model to predict whether an image is a dog or a cat by feeding it images from the "single_prediction" folder. 


Note: Please use TensorFlow (integrated with Keras) to build your CNN model. Within the TensorFlow package, Keras is integrated. Keras was first created as a stand-alone high-level neural networks API, but it was eventually incorporated into TensorFlow as its official high-level deep learning model building and training API. Through this integration, Keras can take advantage of TensorFlow's robust backend, which offers developers an intuitive interface and supports distributed training and efficient computation. With just a few lines of code, Keras makes it easy to design intricate neural networks, making it suitable for both novice and seasoned practitioners. Although Keras is compatible with other backends, its integration with TensorFlow has made it the TensorFlow ecosystem's default API.
